# Mopidy-RadioBrowser

Fork of Ralf's excellent radio browser extention. I have built this capability into a Moode compatible install here: https://github.com/duracell80/MoodeRadio-Get and will be looking to bring configuration options developed there to Mopidy such as limiting the tag list to a reasonable length.

Mopidy extension for playing music from http://www.radio-browser.info. Listen to the worldâ€™s radio with 28,000+ stations of music, sports and news streaming from every continent. Acknowledgement and thanks to Nick Steel's `TuneIn plugin <https://github.com/kingosticks/mopidy-tunein>`_ that was based on. This product uses RadioBrowser API but is not endorsed, certified or otherwise approved in any way by RadioBrowser.

## Installation

Install by running

    sudo python3 setup.py install

Some radio streams may require additional audio plugins.
These can be found in the gstreamer plugin packages for your system.
See https://mopidy.com/ext/radiobrowser/ for alternative installation methods.


## Configuration

Before starting Mopidy, you must add configuration for Mopidy-RadioBrowser to your Mopidy configuration file.
